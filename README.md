## 🚀 Objective

Build a simple personal webpage that includes:

- A heading with your name
- A short paragraph about yourself
- A list of your hobbies

## 🛠️ Getting Started (Windows 10)

### Step 1: Install Git (if you haven't already)

1. Download and install Git from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. During setup, keep default settings.
3. After installation, right-click on your desktop or in a folder and select **"Git Bash Here"**.

### Step 2: Clone the test repository

Use the command below in **Git Bash**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/html-entry-test.git
```

Replace the above link with the one provided to you if it's different.

### Step 3: Create Your Own Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and create a new **public repository** (e.g. `html-entry-test-yourname`)
2. On your PC, copy the contents of the cloned folder into a new folder (e.g. `html-entry-test-yourname`)
3. Open **Git Bash** in that new folder and run:

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with completed HTML test"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/html-entry-test-yourname.git
git push -u origin main
```

> 🔥 Be sure to replace the GitHub link with your actual repository URL.
